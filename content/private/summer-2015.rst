:summary: My super awesome summer 2015. New friends, new experiences and a whole lot of fun.

So. I just want to write this down, so I don't forget it and I want to share it with you. No special reasons behind this
but what is a journal that nobody ever get's to read.

So my summer vacation started on Wednsday, 5th August 2015; my first day of vacation. I went out and got some camping stuff
for my first festival experience. Some months ago my friends, Daniel, Simon and Felix, came to me and asked me if I wanted to join them going to
Taubertal Festival 2015 in Rothenburg ob der Tauber. I was in before they even finished asking me.

The Camping
+++++++++++
After getting everything ready and packing our stuff into Felixs' van, which was pretty packed even though it was also
pretty big. We than headed of to Rothenburg which was approximately a 2 hour drive from our hometown. The drive itself was
of course pretty fun by itself. Arriving at the festival grounds we were greeted by some bavarian policemen who pulled
us out for some questions. We saw the bus before us loosing cans of beer after opening the side door of their bus.
Their embarassement was pretty funny, collecting all their cans back into the van in front of the policemen.

After they were finished they came over to us and asked us if we had any drugs or other illegal stuff in possession, which
we declined. They had a close look into our van and asked to open the trunk. Despite being packed, nothing fell out when
we opened the trunk lid. Stuff stacked 1,5 m high and nothing fell out, that impressed them pretty well. After another
close look at us they sent us our way onto the festival camping ground.

We got checked at the entrance, payed our 5€ trash deposit and followed the never ending flow of metal, rubber and dust.
At the end of the dust we found our personal camping space which quickly got taken over by our tent and the pavilion.
The camping ground was on harvested crop fields, which hadn't seen any rain in some weeks before. It was dry like a desert
and everywhere was straw lying around. That didn't stop anyone from starting they grills and having some bbq.

Simon bought a new 4 person tent and only deployed it halfway at home to check if it was complete. Now imagine our surprise
when we found out that they sent us two left sided sleeping cells. Priceless. We figured out we could still fit the left cell
on the right side, but we had to do some aerobics to get into the cell. Didn't matter, since we didn't want to spent a
lot of time in there.

First thing we did after setting everything up, was getting a, I kid you not, shit&shower flat in the managed and
cleaned sanitary facilities close to our camping ground. For 7€ this was pretty handy and added some comfort to our trip.
Since we arrived at Thursday, so one day early, we just relaxed for the evening and smoked a shisha, which I specifically
bought for the festival.

The Music
+++++++++
We started Friday pretty late. You couldn't sleep that long, since it got hot early. After 10am you couldn't stay in the
tents without starting to sweat instantly. So we just sat around till the first music acts started, that we were interested in.
The location at Taubertal Festival is very interesting. You camp on the hill, while the festival ground, the greencamping
and the river is in the valley. To get into the valley, you have to walk a good 30 minutes from our camp to the entrance.
Some people bought bobby cars and drove them down the hill. There even was a fence where they chained them to while they
were on the festival. While riding down the hill was probably a fun experience, bringing the tuned bobby cars back up the
hill was less fun.

The first bands I saw that weekend were Heisskalt, a local band from Stuttgart and Django 3000, a mix of bavarian folk and
jazz. Neither of them were highlights but I still quite enjoyed listening to them. After that we had some time before
our main acts of the first day which we used to listen to some of the band that participated in the Emergenza Contest.
I was quite impressed by Green Light District, which mix Hip-Hop with some Jazz influences through the use of trumpets and
a crazy saxophone player. After all the smaller bands I was quite excited for my first main act on the festival: Farin
Urlaub Racing Team. The band of Die Ärzte singer and frontman Farin Urlaub is nearly completely staffed with women, only
the four trumpet player are men. The show was great, I enjoyed all of it and fully went crazy with the crowd when the song
11 was played.

We changed a lot that day between the mainstage and the Sounds-for-nature stage. The next act we went to was RDGLDGRN, who
also did a feature with Pharrell Williams. They were great and apparently never played in Germany before. I liked they music
very much and think they will have a future in the business. After they finished my friends had to make a decision. Either
go to The Offspring or have a look at Olli Schulz. I wasn't interested in The Offspring so my decision was pretty clear.
Felix was fighting with himself, but in the end decided to stay with my and enjoy some Olli Schulz act. They took more time then
they were allowed for their setup and it all looked like a big massive chaos. The leadsinger Olli Schulz, hence the name of
the band, was already pissed because the mixed up the time schedule. My friend told me that his appearances always were worse
if he was in a bad mood. There was only one thing we could do: scream our loungs out. The crowd went with us and his mood
tuned around completely. In the end he really loved the festival and even played an additional two songs.

I just now notice how long this will be. We aren't even finished with day 2 of the first festival. Sit back and relax, this
will be along read.

After Olli Schulz we went strait for the mainstage again. I lost all of my friends in the crowd and was in no mood to really
fight for a place in the first 5 rows.
