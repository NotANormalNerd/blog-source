:summary: 2016's trip to the Europython in Bilbao and my thoughts on the conference.

I am on my flight back as I am writing this. So plenty of time.
But I know my track record of actually finishing a blogpost is quite low, but let's just try the following:

 Stop starting, start finishing!

So there it was again: EuroPython 2016. Back to Bilbao. I was excited for it and just to go ahead a bit, I wasn't let down.

The first EuroPython 2016 attendees I met, were at the Airport in Stuttgart.
Touching down in Bilbao, I already knew my way around, so I went to get my baggage and looked for a taxi.
I have learned spanish in school, but it was quite a time ago, so it was a bit rusted.
So what does life give you when you have a situation like this? A non-english speaking taxi driver.

Well it worked out with another taxi driver, hands, feet and Google Maps and in the and I got to my hotel in a fast manner.
(Why do all spanish taxi drivers think they are Fernando Alonso? I will also pay you if you drive according to the speed limit.
Well it was a Mercedes so I was safe :-D)

I was pleasantly surprised by my hotel as my room was on the 9th floor and had a great view.
It was not the greatest view in the world (It was just a tribute *guitars*), but hey, I had a fantastic hotel room.

Since I arrived quite early I dropped of my stuff at the hotel reception and went to look for some lunch.
I tried to find the places from last year, but ended up in a bar I have not been to before and got the local speciality:
Pintxos. Little pieces of bread with something on top. I love them. So much variation.

The weather at this point was a blast. It was sunny and above 40¬∞C on monday and tuesday. So even at 2 am you could easily stand outside the bars and drink a nice cold beer.
The rest of the days proved to be very pleasant with around 28¬∞C and cloudy skies but still warm enough.
I packed for way worse weather and was rewarded with bringing home 70% of my stuff still clean.

Later went to the conference center to get my badge and help with the goodie bag stuffing. It was fun all the way,
but we all were glad when we had the last bag done. So... many... bags...

The sponsors were great this year, although there was no main sponsor as Google was last year. So there were a lot of smaller sponsors.
Microsoft was one sponsor, they even had a stand, but did not care to show any appearance of personnel. Sad.

A big surprise for everyone was the second keynote which was quite strangely after lunch, where they presented the BBC Micro:Bit.
The Micro:Bit is a small Microcomputer with the possibility of running MicroPython. They enhanced the API for the board so that even small schoolchildren could use the board.
It has a 5x5 LED matrix on the front and a Bluetooth Low Energy radio fro Micro:Bit to Micro:Bit communication.

The big surprise: everybody got one. For free. Great!!!
I had quite some fun trying to get them to talk to each other and play some rounds of rock, paper, scissors.
(Somebody came up to me and told me he will extend it to rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock as soon as I publish the code)

The evenings were very social. There was always a group that would form and would just get some dinner together and have great conversations.
One thing you have to know is: Bilbao is a great city with great nightlife. Bars are generally opened till midnight and the streets are
full of people. So getting back to the hotel at 2am was no rare thing. Still making the keynote at 10, without falling asleep,
was the actual hard part about it.

There are several bars and restaurants in Bilbao which you can go to and have phenomenal food for good prices. One tip of mine would be Crazy Horse,
just across the river, close to the Guggenheim museum. They have the XXL Burgers (intended for 2 people, also available as 1 person burgers).
Trip Advisor helped me out a lot on finding good restaurants in Bilbao.

For everything else it was a blast. I met a whole lot of new people and some I met last year from all over Europe and even from the US,
Had a lot of interesting conversations and got new ideas around my personal and professional development. Most of the talks
were well made and very interesting. I plan to give a talk at the next conference myself, I just don't know the topic yet :-).

One very pleasant thing about the EuroPython is that everyone is working towards making everybody comfortable in being there
and empowering women to code. The result is that there is a very high percentage of women compared to the industry statistics.
This just changes the whole atmosphere of the conference and makes it a think tank of different ideas.

For the talks, well see yourself: `EuroPython TV <https://europython.tv/>`_

After 7 days in Bilbao I came back home to my own bed and was sad that my adventure was over for this year,
but also happy that I was back home safe and excited for the next years conference.

To wrap it all up: I had a great time, meeting all kind of new people, getting a new point of view and generally having a phenomenal week.
I will be going to the EuroPython as long as they can keep this spirit and I will be there for sure next year.

So thanks to the EuroPython organizers, all the attendees and everybody I met. See you again next year. Maybe in Milan ;-)
