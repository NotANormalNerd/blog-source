Day Three
=========
Wednesday started of pretty normal. I got out of bed a bit sleep deprived but still okay.
The night before was not as hard on me as I thought. I went to the conference center to
get some breakfast, which was the same as the day before for breakfast and lunch. So
nothing spectecular.

The Keynote was quite interesting, altough a bit confusing and in my opinion missing a
red line to follow through. Looking back it was the most uninteresting one.

Talk one of the day for me was about python security and cryptography. I though I will probably learn some new stuff,
but again the talk was unbearable due to the not understandable speaker, who was apparently from italy. The best part
was Thomas ranting about the speaker, because the 50% of his presentation was wrong. Thomas, being a crypto expert, was
pretty pissed. Next year I will propose he will hold the talk.

The second talk of the day was pretty full. It was Guidos second talk of the conference where he was talking about "his" PEP
and how type hints were helping big projects written in python. He was also argumenting about the optionality of the PEP and
the non-functional changes to python.

After that the day was pretty much over for me. I had lunch, skipped talk 3 and 4, talked to Kathrine from SF but living in Berlin
and started the Google challenge. I wanted to go to the asyncio talks but the rooms were already full, when I wanted to get in.

The evening started with a free beer sponsored by Google. I had some pinxos with some guys I met earlier and started getting to know
them better. The evening went great. Some 'uno mas', a puppy and a lot of fun later, I returned drunkenly to my hotel, dropping into my
bed and sleeping almost instantly. Great stuff. By the way: it was 5am.

Day Four
========
Yeah, well. Day four started when I was woken up by the room cleaning service at around 10am. The woman came in, saw me and
turned around completely embarrassed. I stood up. Still not completely myself, I got dressed as well as I could and walked
over to the conference center to get something to eat, which was by now lunch. I met my colleague and asked him not to
talk about that with our boss, which he kindly agreed to. I still owe him.

After lunch I went to the gitfs talk. The idea was good, the implementation felt a bit of immature. The basic idea was
to have a filesystem that takes care of git underneath but is transparent for the enduser. The rest of the day was not
very good for me. I felt like a piece of garbage and tried to just go from talk to talk.
