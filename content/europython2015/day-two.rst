:summary: My trip to the europython 2015 and a summary of day two

After good, short night full of sleep (the temperatures are surprisingly comfortable here) I went of to the conference
center, just to notice halfway there that I have forgotten my ticket. So I went back to the hotel, while it was already
drizzling. I wore my white whork shirt, so I was a bit worried about it getting too wet, so I had to change before even
getting to the conference, but it worked out well. I still packed some spare Shirts and went of for breakfast.

After having some coffee and some breakfast snacks, my colleague and I went off early to get some good seats for the
Keynote, which of course was completely packed. But what else would you expect if the creator of your programming
language and the face of the python community is having a talk. I also heard the abbreviation BDFL the first time. I will
tell you later what that means, if you don't already googled.

Keynote: Guide van Rossum on the future of Python
=================================================
Guido's talk was very pleasant. That man knows how to talk and how to answer questions. His keynote, in my opinion, is
really worth watching. What else should it be though? He already spoke at a lot of conferences.

He did all of his keynote as a Q&A session, with some questions by himself to himself and then after that, questions from the
audience, alternating between men and women. His own question were mostly questions he already got asked a million times
and probably will be asked another million times, but now probably not at EuroPython.

He went over questions like, what he thinks about the django girls, why to change to python 3 or why there won't be a
python version 2.8. Guide totally supported the idea of the django girls and loved their keynote from the previous day.

I am not going into the details of his talk here. There is a good article on that talk on
`LWN <https://lwn.net/Articles/651967/>`_ about his talk. I recommend you read it if you don't want to watch the whole talk.
Or watch the talk on youtube if you have more time and stamina. I, myself personally, was really interested in his talk
and will probably watch it again.

I think that his talk was great and seeing him on EuroPython made me a little starstruck. I had some smalltalk with him afterwards
and he really seems to be a nice guy, who just enjoys being part of the community. He totally deserves the title of the BDFL.

Collecting T-Shirts
===================
After the keynote was over, I went and talked to some of the guys at the sponsor booths. They all seemed to be really
enjoying what they were doing and knew exactly why they were at the EuroPython Conference. Some of them gave away free
T-Shirts, so I went ahead and tried to collect them all. First of I got a T-Shirt from the Numberly guys. Really kind and
friendly, those french.

After that I went ahead to the FanDuel Guys. A startup that has one day fantasy leagues and is pretty big in the USA. I
never have heard of them before that. Probably mostly due to the fact that fantasy leagues are not a thing in Germany. We
like our football manager simulations a lot more. They were also pretty nice and totally convinced of their startup. They
also gave away free Ts, so there goes number two. They were all looking for developers for their platforms of course. But
moving to Ireland or the USA is just not an option for me currently.

After I had some more coffee, I went ahead and went for the first talk of the day.

Shame on lazy me
================

Okay. This is me. Nearly two month after starting to write this blogpost. I wanted to do one for each day but looking back
at it, it would just be to much. Both to read and to write. So now I will just summarise the days and what was my most important
part of that day. I hope you enjoy it even though it will be a lot shorter than planned.

Day Two
=======
The first talk of the day was about DEPOT, which was a framework to abstract the storage level and make it more interchangable.
This was for me the most interesting talk of the day und I will keep an eye on that project. After that I went on a TDD talk
and a microservices talk, which were sadly very disappointing and uninteresting to me.

At lunch I saw Guido walking around and still starstruck as I was, I tried to talk to him, trying to hide my amazement for
him. So I went over and stroke up some smalltalk which went pretty well, in my view. After leaving Guido by himself again I
went and got some of the pinxos they prepared for the attendees. While we were feasting the weather got pretty nasty outside
with heavy rain. So heavy the roof of the conference center began leaking.

Being a happy and fed person after lunch I went ahead to the next talks. I went to watch another TDD talk and some talk
which should give a deep lock at logging but was essentially a better logging 101 for beginner talk. Even on twitter there
were some complaints to recategorize the talks and give some of the speakers a better or even some training at all.

In the afternoon there was the coffeebreak which essentially was a repetition of the breakfast. The last point of the evening
for me were the recruiting sessions. Zalando, HP, Red Hat and many more were advertising for their companys. Some were quite
interesting and some were just standup. A point of improvement for everybody doing them: bring a developer. I am not
interested in your good looking HR representative. I want to hear how working at your company is from someone who knows.

The evening was a spontaneous meetup of different people via twitter. We went across the river into a pub which offered
double person burgers for a pretty cheap price, called Crazy Horse. We drank a lot of beer and had some crazy conversations.
I think I was back in the hotel at about 2 AM, which was okay for me. My colleague didn't join us again, just like the rest
of the week. I still had fun and made some really cool new friends.
