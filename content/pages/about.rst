Hi, my name is Dennis.
	Born 1992 in Germany. I studied Business Informatics and worked for IBM while studing.
	I left them after University for various reasons and became a full time python developer at a company called Dialkog Semiconductor.

	My first programming language was php, after teaching myself HTML and CSS and building a "dynamic" webpage.
	After that I learned Java and the basics of assembler in highschool, together with all the theoretical stuff of programming like patterns, databases and so on.
	I used my knowledge in college to impress, but didn't really learn anything but what I already knew.

	A friend of mine told me about python and I discovered a new world. I got to do a proof of concept at IBM that had to do with openstack and some mainframe components.
	This was the first full python project I did. After that I used it for small scripts and saved a lot of time, automating tasks I got in other projects.
	
	I am also a little bit interested in system administration and have multiple servers, including a HP N40L & Gen8 homeserver which is mostly used as a NAS.
	Other interests include making music and flying, as in soaring. Sometimes I pick up my camera and make some pictures, but mostly I am to lazy for that.
	Microprocessors like the Micro:Bit and the ESP8266 are getting more and more attention from me as they get better and better in filing certain usecases.

What are you doing with Python?
    I currently try to shift my whole IT Team into the present and after that into the future.
    When thinking of Python my mind circles around topics like automation, data processing, web interfaces and APIs.
    But also around community and open source.

    My main focus therefore lies in using Django, Flask, Celery, Ansible, Vagrant, but also writing own libraries to solve problems custom to our situation.

What are your goals?
	My goals for my professional career are pretty clear.

	I want to become a better programmer, interact with the python community and one day hold a keynote. Therefore I still have to learn and make experiences everyday.
	I always try to teach and mentor other young people in pursuing a programmers career or at least learn the basics of programming.

What is this all about?
	***This*** is my blog.

	You will mainly find technical stuff here. At least that's the plan.
	There can be parts about my photography or some videos I made, but mostly this will be a place where I share my solutions and thoughts on technical problems.

So feel welcome to browse around and leave your thoughts on the topics I write about.

| Till then,
| keep on coding.
